	* This allows users to enjoy much faster and more frequent updates and thus more accurate information

üîú This will soon be published to Addons.mozilla.org (AMO), Addons.thunderbird.net (ATN) and possibly the Chrome Web Store.

Use on Thunderbird requires renaming the [thunderbirdmanifest.json](thunderbirdmanifest.json) file to `manifest.json`.
Use on Chromium/Chrome requires the downloading the [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) and renaming the [chromemanifest.json](chromemanifest.json) file to `manifest.json`.

\* Requires supported program
